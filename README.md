# Brew-upup

External command for `homebrew` for the lazy people who do not wish to write more than a single command to upgrade their packages and uninstall the old versions of them.

## Installation

`$ brew tap goibon/upup`

## Usage

```
Usage: brew upup [--cleanup] [--quiet]

    -c, --cleanup                    Calls brew cleanup after the last step
    -q, --quiet                      Runs quietly with no output unless
                                     something goes wrong
    -h, --help                       Show this message.
```

Will call `brew update` followed by `brew upgrade` optionally followed by `brew cleanup` if the `--cleanup` option was passed.
